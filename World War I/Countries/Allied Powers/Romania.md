Kingdom of Romania [[1916]]

- Head of State was [[King Ferdinand I]]
- Entered the war on August 27, 1916 when Romania declared war on [[Austria-Hungary]]

	- Immediately after declaring war, Romania launched an offensive into Transylvania which had early success but was soon crushed by all four of the Central Powers
	- After retreating to eastern Moldavia, the Romanians slowly rebuilt their army and supported [[Russia]]
