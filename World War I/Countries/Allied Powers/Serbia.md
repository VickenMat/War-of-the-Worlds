- Bore the greatest responsibility for the outbreak of World War I
- With the [[Ottoman Empire]] on the decline, Serbian nationalism and expansionism were disruptive forces
- There was already unrest among the Serbian population because of [[Austria-Hungary]] oppression
- Angry with [[Austria-Hungary]] because they viewed the annexation of [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] (and closing trade routes to the Adriatic Sea) in 1908 as a provocation
- Backing the Black Hand terrorists after [[Franz Ferdinand]] assassination was extraordinarily irresponsible
- Seeing [[Austria-Hungary]] make the first move, a domino effect of mobilization occurred
- Backed by [[Russia]] because they feared an Austro-German pact
