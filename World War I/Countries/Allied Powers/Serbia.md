Kingdom of Serbia [[1914]]

- Head of State was [[King Petar I]] until [[1918]]
	- Prime Minister was [[Nikola Pasic]]
- Entered the war on August 3, 1914 when [[Austria-Hungary]] declared war on Serbia
	- On October of [[1915]], [[Bulgaria]] joining the Central Power offensive caused the Serbians to retreat to the Albanian coast, then to the Greek island of Corfu
	- Many died, but the survivors re-equipped and served alongside the [[France]], [[Great Britain]], and [[Italy]] soldiers against the Bulgarians and Austrians
	- 710,000 soldiers mobilized during the war, with 530,000 deployed in 1914
- Ceased hostilities on November 11, 1918 after armistice with [[Germany]]
	- [[Treaty of Trianon]] signed by the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes
	- 450,000 military and 650,000 civilian casualties
	- Landlocked and isolated from the Allies, Serbian civilians faced famine and disease through destroyed farmland and infrastructure
- On December 1 1918, the Kingdom of Serbia was superseded by the new Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenians, which incorporated Serbia, Montenegro, and the 'South Slav' regions of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. This is now known as [[Yugoslavia]], or South Slavia
- Serbia bore the greatest responsibility for the outbreak of World War I
	- With the [[Ottoman Empire]] on the decline, Serbian nationalism and expansionism were disruptive forces
- The Austria-Hungary annexation of [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] (and closing trade routes to the Adriatic Sea) in 1908 along with civil unrest due to oppression were provocation to attack
- Following the assassination of [[Franz Ferdinand]], the Serbians backing the Black Hand terrorists was extraordinarily irresponsible
- Seeing Austria-Hungary make the first move, a domino effect of mobilization occurred
- Backed by [[Russia]] because they feared an Austro-German pact
