[[Western Front]], [[1915]]

The notion of "It will be over by Christmas" was met with the reality of modern warfare in early 1915. The British and French undertook a series of unsuccessful attacks against the Germans on the Western Front. Apart from their only offensive at Ypres, the Germans spent the year on the defensive, but both sides learned a harsh lesson.
