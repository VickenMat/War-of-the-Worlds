- On December 24 [[1914]], 
- [[Bruce Bairnsfather]], a British machine gunner and later cartoonist wrote a memoirs about his time in the war, including this storied night
	- "Cold, wet through and covered with mud. There didn't seem the slightest chance of leaving - except in an ambulance."
	- "I could hear the murmur of voices. Do you hear the Boches (Germans) kicking up that racket over there?"
		- The Germans were singing carols on Christmas Eve in the darkness, and the British soldiers began to sing back.
	- Then he heard a ... voice from an enemy soldier, speaking in English with a strong German accept ... saying "Come over here."
		- One of the British sergeants answered:
	- "You come half-way. I come half-way"
		- Enemy soldiers began to climb nervously out of their trenches and to meet at the barbed wire in [[No Man's Land]]
		- There were handshakes, words of kindness, and trading songs, tobacco, and wine
	- "Here they were - the actual practical soldiers of the German Army. There was not an atom of hate on either side"
		- But it wasn't **just** that night as pockets of troops from [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], and [[Great Britain]] singing carols along the [[Western Front]], with some reports of it occurring on the [[Eastern Front]] too
		- Most soldiers figured the war would be over quickly and they'd be with their families in time for the holidays
		- Both sides had low morale as the [[Battle of Tannenberg]] and [[Battle of the Marne]] ended decisively in German and British's favor respectively
- Another British soldier named John Ferguson wrote "Here we were laughing and chatting to men whom only a few hours before we were trying to kill"
- German soldiers were using candles to light Christmas trees around their trenches
- Soccer Game
	- One British fighter named Ernie Williams said in a makeshift game of soccer "The ball appeared from somewhere, I don't know where... They made up some goals and one fellow went in goal and then it was just a general kick-about. I should think there were a couple hundred taking part."
	- A German Lieutenant Kurt Zehmisch wrote, "Eventually the English brought a soccer ball from their trenches, and pretty soon a lively game ensued... How marvelously wonderful, yet how strange it was. The English officers felt the same way about it. Thus, Christmas, the celebration of Love, managed to bring moral enemies together as friends for a time"
- Not everyone liked it
	- One German soldier, [[Adolf Hitler]] scolded his men during the Truce saying "Such a thing should not happen in wartime. Have you no German sense of honor left?"
	- High command was especially displeased with the Truce and issued orders for it to never happen again
		- No Christmas Truce would happen for the rest of the war

Significance
- For just one day, parts of the world returned to sanity
