- #### Who was "right"?
	- [[Germany]]
		- They had just underwent an arduous series of unification processes and wars to cement their state and sovereignty and had a history of separation and intrusion
		- The German people truly though that was would be the only means of maintained their integrity as a nation
			- *Seeking to raise Germany's prestige to new heights with another war in Europe, a throwback to 19th century thinking*
	- [[France]]
		- They had just been humiliated in a war engineered by Bismarck and Prussian establishment
		- They had lost territory in a claim of ethnic suppression and were aiming to reclaim what they thought were rightfully theirs
		- National price would not allow falling by the wayside
			- *Looking to reclaim Alsace and Lorraine as well as undo the humiliation she endured during the Franco-Prussian War*
	- [[Great Britain]]
		- Drawn into conflict they wanted no part of due to the 1839 Treaty of London which forced her hand when Germany invaded [[Belgium]]
		- Britain could not stand idly and allow Germany to secure the northern coast of France, which would be strategically unacceptable
			- *Interested in maintaining the status-quo of Europe with France and Russia as her allies*
	- [[Russia]]
		- Had made great efforts to secure the integrity of the Balkans only to possess a secure buffer from Bulgaria, Ottoman Empire, and Austria-Hungary
		- Russia aligned with France who guaranteed [[Serbia]] independence, a security that could allow for casus belli when needed most against its logical rival, Austria-Hungary
			- *Sought to reclaim prestige, humiliated in the Russo-Japanese War beyond measure. Also issue of continually rising Germany on her borders, cutting Russia off from the rest of Europe if war came. The Great War was an attempt to move the borders*
	- [[Austria-Hungary]]
		- Their struggle towards unification made their leadership paranoid that something may lead to a division of the dualist monarchy
		- The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand became significant to the political elite who feared an uprising, culminating in their ultimatum to Serbia
			- *Aimed for the preservation of empire while Slavic nationalism was proving to be a threat to their power in the Balkans. The continued Russian and western powers' support of Slavic movement added fuel to the fire*
	- [[Ottoman Empire]]
		- Considered the "Sick Man of Europe", which fell in the aftermath of the Great War
		- Had a long history of multi-ethnic rule and her slow decay, both internally and externally was eating faster and faster as the war approached
		- The assassination of the Archduke provided an opportunity to reassert herself on the European stage and reclaim the glory she once possessed
			- *Similar to Austria-Hungary, they aimed to keep their empire together and potentially rebuilding with newfound prestige. There was also a Russian threat to take Constantinople and annex large parts of eastern Turkey (modern day Azerbaijan). The war would provide an opportunity to stem this encroachment*
	- [[Italy]]
		- Fought the Ottomans in North Africa, claiming much of the coast to themselves
		- Had vested interest in the weakening of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and reclaiming territory thought to be hers, the famous Italian irredentism
			- *Sough to regain control of ethnically Italian areas from Austria-Hungary. Played the waiting game with Germany and Austria-Hungary while she backdoored negotiations with France and Britain aimed at bringing her to the Entente side. The [[Treaty of London]] (1915) was meant to secure this future*
	- [[United States]]
		- 
	- Answer?
		- No one was truly "right" as each nation aimed to secure their own interests rather than preserve a rule of law and international order
		- Nations cannot be "right or wrong" because they are not subjective entities
			- They hold interests, not beliefs or morals
		- The Great War was a messy complex event that goes beyond simple attributions of responsibility or fault
			- The War was realpolitik in action with the gravest of consequences only to be concluded with idealpolitik
