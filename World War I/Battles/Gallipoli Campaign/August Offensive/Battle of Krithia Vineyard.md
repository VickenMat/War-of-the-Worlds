Krithia Vineyard [[1915]]

- Allied 29th Division attack launched on August 6 1915 during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] 
- Goal was to divert attention and defenders so the [[Battle of Sari Bair]] (primary target) could be captured
- [[Great Britain]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] went back and forth capturing trenches, but the Turks were able to repel them on August 13
- Casualties were heavy as the British lost two thirds of their fighting force
- Ultimately drew more Ottoman defenders north, hampering the Sari Bair offensive

Significance
- Meant to draw Ottoman reinforcements to a less strategic point to allow British troops to attack Sari Bair range
- British took many losses for an insignificant amount of land
- Ottomans reinforced the north regardless, hampering the British attacks at the range
