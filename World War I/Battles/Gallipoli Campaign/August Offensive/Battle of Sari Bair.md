- Also known as the "August Offensive", the Battle of Sari Bair represented a final [[Great Britain]] attempt at taking control of the peninsula
- With two fronts established at [[Cape Helles]] (massive casualties for little territorial gain) and [[Anzac Cove]] (stalemate trench warfare), the British began a new campaign to capture the Sari Bair ridge
	- The Sari Bair Ridge was the high ground which overlooked the middle of the peninsula above Anzac cove
- The [[Ottoman Empire]] anticipated a breakout from Anzac Cove would come, but were unsure if it was to the north at Suvla Bay or south at Gabe Tepe
- [[General Sir Ian Hamilton]], commander of the [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]], now armed with the 10th, 11th, 13th, 53rd, and 54th divisions, led the attack
- Suvla Bay was relatively undefended, as the Turks viewed its rugged terrain as a natural deterrent
	- Only [[Mustafa Kemal]] expected an attack here, but was unable to convince his superiors to reinforce the area
- The Allied attack was directed at two summits; Chunuk Bair and Hill 971, both of which were expected to be captured by dawn of August 6
	- As a distraction, an Allied attack was launched on August 6 at the [[Battle of Lone Pine]] and [[Battle of Krithia Vineyard]], resulting in the capture of Ottoman trenches and a struggle over meaningless land respectively
		- This however, attracted more reinforcements to the north, ultimately hampering the Suvla Bay landings
- [[Battle of Chunuk Bair]] saw a short lived capture of the summit on August 7
- The division tasted with taking Hill 971 became lost and never got close to their objective
	- British forces launched an attack from the wrong location, mistaken about their position relative to Hill 971
- The combination of insufficient terrain knowledge, disease, and lack of numbers caused a retreat from the area and a large number of casualties 

Significance
- Beginning of the "August Offensive"
- Effort to break up the stalemate at [[Anzac Cove]] and [[Cape Helles]]
- Ended in Allied retreat
