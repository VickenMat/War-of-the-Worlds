Lone Pine lies on the south-west arm of 400 Plateau

- Planned by [[General Sir Ian Hamilton]] and launched by [[William Birdwood]] on August 6 [[1915]], Lone Pine was to be a diversionary operation intended to shift the focus away from the [[Suvla Bay]] landings as a part of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] 
- 4,600 Australian soldiers attacked [[Ottoman Empire]] trenches near dusk, only to find them fortified by earth and logs
- Allied and Ottoman soldiers engaged in fierce hand to hand combat in the darkness in trenches
	- There was insufficient room to use either grenades or bayonets, so fists and knives were the primary methods of attacking
- Within two days, Lone Pine was in Allied control but still enduring waves of Turkish counter-attacks
- The Lone Pine attacks proved problematic because the Turk defenders were now in a better position to push onto the Sari Bair Range in the [[Battle of Sari Bair]] once its importance became clearer
- 10,000 casualties, 9,000 of whom died
	- 6,930 Ottoman
	- 3,000 Australian casualties

Significance
- Originally set up as a diversionary attack from the Suvla Bay landings
- Heavy casualties on both sides, while not drawing as much attention as intended
