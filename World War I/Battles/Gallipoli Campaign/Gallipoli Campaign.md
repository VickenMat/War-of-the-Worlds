April [[1915]] landing

- The deadlock on the [[Western Front]] led the allies scurrying to find other avenues of attack
- [[Winston Churchill]], the political head of the Royal Navy and aspiring military strategist, would be the Gallipoli invasion's chief advocate
	- He believed taking Constantinople would link the Mediterranean and Black Sea, allowing for a clear sea route to [[Russia]] to knock out the [[Ottoman Empire]]
	- Britain's war cabinet backed the plan, although supporting it with less troops than Churchill desired, and the first step would be to invade the Gallipoli Peninsula
	- He would end up taking British, French, and untested Australian and New Zealand forces into battle
- The Dardanelles Straight would lead to the Turkish capital of Constantinople (Istanbul), but the was heavily fortified with minefields, fortifications, and gun emplacements due to its strategic importance
	- The failure of naval forces to destroy these defenses (Alerting the Ottomans and eliminating the element of surprise) in February and March 1915 forced the Allies to send troops to seize the peninsula
- In wake of the failed naval attack, on April 25 1915, [[General Sir Ian Hamilton]] landed the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (Anzac) near Gaba Tepe at Ari Burnu (now known as [[Anzac Cove]]) and the British 29th Division at [[Cape Helles]], beginning the Gallipoli Campaign
- Opposing him was German officer [[Liman von Sanders]] who had a force of 84,000 Turkish troops
	- **Goal** of the campaign
		- Allow [[Great Britain]] and [[France]] to open supply lines by linking the Mediterranean and Black Sea to support Russia
		- Strengthen the Allied Middle East
		- Capture Constantinople and the Dardanelles Straights to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war
- Cape Helles Landing
	- Led by [[Aylmer Hunter-Weston]], the British Division made 5 beach landings at Cape Helles
		- Y Beach was originally undefended and captured, but later evacuated after Ottoman reinforcements arrived
		- W and V Beaches saw heavy British casualties due to barbed wire and heavily defended Ottoman positions
		- V Beach faced heavy machine gun fire from the Sedd-el-Bahr fortress
			- Only 21 of 200 men made it ashore
		- S Beach was taken shortly
	- Ultimately, the British offensive at Helles came at a massive human cost for little gain
- Anzac Cove Landing
	- Led by [[William Birdwood]], the goal was to take the Sari Bair Range and once in control, move across the peninsula to cut off the southern half and prevent Ottoman reinforcements
	- Although unopposed at Anzac Cove, the mismanagement of landing zones led to steep cliff climbing to reach the heights which allowed for Ottoman reinforcements
		- [[Mustafa Kemal]] of the Ottomans personally led the 57th Regiment 
	- Fighting, particularly at Anzac cove, soon turned into a trench warfare stalemate, similar to the Western Front
- August Offensive
	- Launched on August 6, its goal was to land at [[Suvla Bay]] to push across the peninsula and be a diversionary attack to take attention away from Cape Helles
	- [[Battle of Chunuk Bair]] commenced north of Anzac cove, near the hills of Chunuk Bair
	- [[Battle of Lone Pine]] and [[Battle of Krithia Vineyard]] were failed attempts to divert Ottoman attention from the [[Battle of Sari Bair]]
	- The offensive as a whole slowed and lost momentum by August 10 due to stiff Turkish resistance and indecisive Allied command
	- In late August the [[Battle of Scimitar Hill]] and [[Battle of Hill 60]] were launched in another attempt to break out of Suvla Bay, but the Allies couldn't advance and had to dig in
- The Allies were trapped at Helles, Anzac, and Suvla Bay, all of which were overlooked by high ground and under artillery and infantry fire
	- Casualties were heavy, the summer heat pounded on the soldiers, disease was rampant, and food became inedible, and swarms of corpse flies surrounded them
- In January [[1916]], the British withdrew the Allied army from Gallipoli with minimal losses
	- Hamilton was dismissed and replaced because he opposed a withdrawal, fearing the loss of prestige
	- The Allies evacuated 105,000 men and 300 guns from Anzac Cove and Suvla Bay and 35,000 men from Cape Helles
- In the aftermath, each side suffered roughly 250,000 casualties with 46,000 Allied and 65,000 Turkish troops dead

Significance
- Goal was to seize control of the Dardanelles Straight to have access to Constantinople and link the Mediterranean Sea with the Black Sea, which would have given France and Britain a direct supply line to Russia
- The offensive was considered a disaster from the Allied perspective and rejuvenated the Ottoman war effort
- Churchill, fairly or unfairly was considered the scapegoat
- A supply line for Russia would not be established and the new front to undercut the Central Powers would fail to exist
