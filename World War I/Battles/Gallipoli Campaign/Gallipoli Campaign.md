[[1915]] landing

- April 25 1915, [[General Sir Ian Hamilton]] decided to land the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (Anzac) near Ari Burnu (now known as Anzac cove) and the British 29th Division at Cape Helles, beginning the Gallipoli Campaign
	- Goal of the invasion
		- Weakened Central Powers
		- Allowed [[Great Britain]] and [[France]] to support [[Russia]]
		- Strengthen the Middle East
- Neither landing was successful, as the [[Ottoman Empire]] repelled both the British and Anzacs
	- Fighting, particularly at Anzac cove, soon turned into trench warfare, as in the [[Western Front]]
- Casualties were heavy, the summer heat pounded on the soldiers, disease was rampant, and food became inedible, and swarms of corpse flies surrounded them
- In August, the [[Battle of Chunuk Bair]] commenced  north of Anzac cove, near the hills of Chunuk Bair
