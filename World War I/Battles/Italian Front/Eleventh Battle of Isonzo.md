Italian 75mm anti-aircraft gun

- Fought on August 18 [[1917]] between [[Italy]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]
- As their final offensive, the Italians attempted to end the war of attrition by sending 51 divisions and 5,200 guns to Carso and the bridgehead at Gorizia
- At first, the attack was so successful that the infantry outran their artillery and supply lines
	- However, the Austro-Hungarian line eventually held and the continuation of the attack was abandoned on September 12
- After this retreat, no further offensives were launched along the Isonzo
- In late October, Germany committed reinforcements to the Austro-Hungarian army along the Isonzo after seeing it was at a breaking point
	- The war nearing an end on the Eastern front due to the [[Russian Revolution]] allowed to Germans more infantry to send
- Referred to as the Battle of Caporetto, or the Twelfth Battle of Isonzo, the Central Powers nearly knocked Italy out of the war after pushing them out of the Isonzo region


Significance
- Final offensive along the Isonzo River launched by the Italians
