11 battles in Northeastern [[Italy]] along the Isonzo River, [[1915]] - [[1917]]

- With mountains flanking its sides, the Isonzo River was the only practical area for the Italian military to conduct operations
	- The Austro-Hungarians had fortified the mountains prior to Italy joining the was on May 23 1915
	- The Isonzo River itself was prone to flooding, and it showed as it received record rainfalls from [[1914]] - [[1918]], slowing the attacks
- Fought on the Italian Front along the Isonzo River (modern day Slovenia) between [[Italy]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] forces 
- Beginning on June 23 1915, the Italian Army's **objective** was to drive the Austrians from their defensive positions along the Isonzo to capture the port of Trieste
- The **paradox** the Italians faced was that in order to safely cross the river, they would need to take out it Austro-Hungarians looking down at them from the mountains, but in order to knock them out, they needed to cross the river first
	- The Italians came into the battle with a 2:1 numeric advantage (200,000 to 100,000)
	- They had intended to have multiple surprise attacks, all of which were expected
		- The Austrians had a year head start with their trenches and defensive fortifications
- The Italians made the same **mistakes** which were made at the [[Western Front]], sending massed infantry offensives without sufficient artillery protection
	- The lines along the river would be defined by trench warfare
- After minor gains at Monte Nero, Monte Colowrat, and Plezzo, fighting would continue around Gorizia
	- Fighting in Gorizia consisted of street by street urban warfare, backed by artillery
- In early July, the Austro-Hungarians thwarted the Italian assault after receiving reinforcements 
- The Italian offensive was called off on July 7 after more Austrian reinforcements arrived, defending with their well positioned guns
	- The Second Battle of Isonzo was launched only eleven days later on July 18 1915
- Casualties for the entire Isonzo campaign were massive, including 300,000 Italians (of their 600,000 total war casualties) and 200,000 Austro-Hungarians (of their 1.2 million war casualties)
- There were a debated total of 12 battles at Isonzo


Significance
- First Italian offensive on the Isonzo River and its surround area was denied by Austro-Hungarian troops
- To safely cross the river, the Italians needed to take out the defenders in the mountains, but to get to the mountains, they needed to cross the river
- The Italians would never succeed
