Ships from the German High Seas Fleet, June [[1916]]

- Also called Battle of Skagerrak
- Fought near the Skagerrak (60 miles off the west coast of Jutland), an arm of the North Sea between [[Great Britain]] and [[Germany]] battle fleets on May 31 [[1916]]
- In late Spring, months after the Battle of Dogger Bank, the British Royal Navy faced off against the German High Seas Fleet 
	- The British welcomed this engagement as they though their firepower and numbers were superior
	- However, sailing into the submarine and torpedo-boat trap of German home waters was not to be recommended, so the British left them alone
- The German plan as to let the submarines pick off British ships until it was sufficiently small enough to attack, but this policy failed
- On May 31 1916, Germany's fleet of 100 ships manning 45,000 soldiers and officers would unknowingly come face to face with British 151 ships and 60,000 men in history's largest naval battle to that date
- By the battles end on June 1, the British had sustained greater losses than the Germans in both ships and men
	- 100,000 men aboard 250 ships had engaged over 3 days time
	- 6,768 British had been killed or wounded with 14 ships sunk (three battle cruisers) while 3,058 German men had been killed or wounded with 11 ships sunk (one battle cruiser and one battleship)
	- Germany was the first country to employ submarines in war, although this battle was not its introduction
	- Germany would not make any more attempts to break the Allied blockade on the North Sea for the remainder of the war

Significance
- British defeat at sea to undermanned German hands
- Bloodiest day in British naval history 
- German press gave worldwide impression that the Royal Navy had suffered a serious loss
- Despite the loss, the **balance of power** in the North Sea had remained unchanged as the British still dominated 
- Greatest naval battle in World War 1
