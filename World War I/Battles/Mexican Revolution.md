Aftermath of the "Ten Tragic Days", 1913

- U.S. Intervention and Rebellion against Huerta
	- Opposition to Huerta's drunken, inefficient, and despotic rule grew
	- [[Venustiano Carranza]], Pancho Villa, Alvaro Obregon, and Zapata formed an uneasy alliance, supported by [[Woodrow Wilson]] who refused to recognize Huerta
	- In April [[1914]], to prevent Huerta from receiving an arms shipment from Germany, the U.S. naval forces seized Veracruz

- Civil War
	- In spring and summer 1914, the allied rebel forces converged on Mexico City, forcing Huerta into exile in July
	- Carranza declared himself president to the objection of Villa, Obregon, and Zapata
		- Bloodshed ensued until [[Eulalio Gutierrez]] becomes interim president
		- Villa and Zapata back Gutierrez while Obregon re-allied with Carranza
		- They routed Villa in a bloody battle in April 1915 at Celaya
			- Known as the beginning of the end for Villa
		- Villa blamed his defeat on Wilson's support of Carranza and launched attacks on towns bordering the U.S. and Mexico
			- Executed 17 U.S. citizens at Santa Isabel in January [[1916]]
			- Killed 17 Americans on a raid in Columbus, New Mexico
	- Carranza presided over the constitution of [[1917]] which gave the government the right to confiscate land from wealthy landowners, guaranteed worker's rights, and limited the rights of the Roman Catholic Church
		- Zapata was assassinated in [[1919]]
	- In 1920, Carranza lost all his supporters when attempting to break up a railroad strike and was killed attempting to flee the capital on May 21st
