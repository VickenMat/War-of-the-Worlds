Schlieffen Plan for Western Front

- Constructed in 1905 by [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] as a result of the Russo-Japanese war and considered "preventative war"
- Following the war, [[Russia]] would need to recoverer their economy and army and was not considered a serious threat to [[Germany]], but in the near future would be **invincible**
	- Both the [[France]] and [[Great Britain]] governments realized this too and pursued friendlier relations with Russia
	- The international events of 1905 and 1906 was the beginning of the Germany's perceived "encirclement" by alliances of potential enemies
- Schlieffen's Plan was a quick victory in the West against France while initially being on the defensive in the East against Russia
	- Alfred von Schlieffen believed a two-front war was inevitable, so the plan was to fight two one-front wars
	- Schlieffen counted on two things
		- Quick victory in France, which he estimated to be 6 weeks
		- Russian mobilization would be slow, allowing a smaller German army to be defensive for that time
	- Once France had been defeated, the full force of the German army would be directed towards Russia
- Following the attacks on a neutral [[Belgium]], Germany's enemies knew they were fighting a ruthless enemy, and propaganda would rally countries against them
- Ultimately, the defeat at the [[Battle of the Marne]] ended the Schlieffen Plan and signified this was a long term war
