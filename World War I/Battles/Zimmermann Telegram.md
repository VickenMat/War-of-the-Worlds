Decoded Zimmermann Telegram

- Following the sinking of the Lusitania and S.S. Arabic, relations between [[Germany]] and the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]] had become extremely strained
	- The Zimmerman Telegram was secretly sent on January 16 [[1917]] but intercepted by British Intelligence a few days later
	- From the German Foreign Minister, [[Arthur Zimmermann]], to the German Minister of Mexico, [[Henrich von Eckhardt]]
	- Stated that Germany would return to unrestricted submarine warfare, and proposing an alliance between Germany, Mexico, and Japan should the United States declare war
	- Germany would aid in Mexico should they reconquer Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona
- Although not immediately entering the war, after unrestricted submarine warfare did continue, in April 1917, the U.S. Congress voted to declare war on the Central Powers

Significance
- Acted as the final straw for the United States to enter the war
