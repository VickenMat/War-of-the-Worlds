Front page of the New York Times, 1915

- On May 7 [[1915]], a luxury British passenger liner, Lusitania, is torpedoed and sunk by [[Germany]] U-Boat off the southern coast of Ireland
	- It was headed from New York to Liverpool
- 1,195 people are killed, including 128 [[United States]] citizens
- Although remaining a passenger ship, it was secretly modified for war and was carrying 170 tons of rifle ammunition and artillery shells
	- By February of 1915, German naval commanders knew the British were arming both merchant and passenger ships, sending supplies from the United States to Europe
	- Germany declared the water surrounding the British Isles a **war zone**
		- This broke the international naval protocol, "prize laws" and angered the Allies and U.S.
- Therefore, Germany felt justified in treating the boat as a valid target in a declared war zone
	- Days before the Lusitania left New York, the German Embassy in the U.S. reminded Americans that [[Great Britain]] and Germany were at were, and to avoid ships with the British flag
		- It was assumed that Germany would allow passengers to use lifeboats, so these ads were ignored
- This immediately strained relations between Germany and the United States
	- [[Woodrow Wilson]] urged caution and neutrality while former president Teddy Roosevelt wanted retaliation
