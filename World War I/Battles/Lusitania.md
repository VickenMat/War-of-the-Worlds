Front page of the New York Times, 1915

- On May 7 [[1915]], a luxury British passenger liner, Lusitania, is torpedoed and sunk by [[Germany]] U-Boat off the southern coast of Ireland
	- It was headed from New York to Liverpool
- 1,195 people are killed, including 128 [[United States]] citizens
- Although remaining a passenger ship, it was secretly modified for war and was carrying 170 tons of rifle ammunition and artillery shells
	- By February of 1915, German naval commanders knew the British were arming both merchant and passenger ships, sending supplies from the United States to Europe
	- Germany declared the water surrounding the British Isles a **war zone**
		- This broke the international naval protocol, "prize laws" and angered the Allies and U.S.
- Therefore, Germany felt justified in treating the boat as a valid target in a declared war zone
	- They defended their actions, claiming Lusitania was carrying ammunition in the declared war zone and was considered fair game
	- Days before the Lusitania left New York, the German Embassy in the U.S. reminded Americans that [[Great Britain]] and Germany were at were, and to avoid ships with the British flag
		- It was assumed that Germany would allow passengers to use lifeboats, so these ads were ignored
- This immediately strained relations between Germany and the United States
	- [[Woodrow Wilson]] urged caution and neutrality while former president Teddy Roosevelt wanted retaliation
	- Anti-German British propaganda caused riots to break out in London
- Later that year in August, the British liner S.S. Arabic was sunk by German U-Boats who claimed self defense
	- The U.S. threatened that if it was determined that the ship was sunk without cause, they'd enter the war
	- Germany caved and announced they would no longer sink passenger ships without a warning
	- Wilson was still not ready to take his country to war, but relations had become extremely strained
- In early [[1917]], British intelligence intercepted a telegram from the German Foreign Minister, [[Arthur Zimmermann]], to the German Minister of Mexico, [[Henrich von Eckhardt]]
	- Stated that Germany would return to unrestricted submarine warfare, and proposing an alliance between them and Mexico
- Although not immediately entering the war, after unrestricted submarine warfare did continue, in April 1917, the U.S. Congress voted to declare war on the Central Powers

Significance
- Although not directly causing the U.S. to enter the war, the sinking of Lusitania strained relations between the two and fueled anti-German sentiment in Britain and U.S.
- Showed that Germany was willing to do anything to win the war
	- Allies fought harder
	- Neutrality was futile
