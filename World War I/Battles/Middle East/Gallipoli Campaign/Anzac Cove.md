[[Anzac Cove]], [[1915]]

- On April 25, [[1915]], [[General Sir Ian Hamilton]] led [[Great Britain]] and its empire into simultaneous beach landings at Anzac Cove and [[Cape Helles]] as part of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]
- Anzac Cove, originally known as Ari Burnu and labeled as 'Z' Beach was far better managed by [[William Birdwood]] as opposed to the Helles landings led by [[Aylmer Hunter-Weston]]
	- Opposing him was [[Liman von Sanders]], a German officer attached to the region and 84,000 Turkish troops from the [[Ottoman Empire]]
- The attacking force was 17,000 untested soldiers from the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]]
- Taking advantage of the relatively unopposed landings at Ari Burnu, Birdwood advanced until the [[Battle of Chunuk Bair]], where Turkish forces led by [[Mustafa Kemal]] would repel the Allies back to the beach
- Although both the Anzac Cove and Cape Helles landings had been achieved, advances had not been made in the first day
	- Stalemate had set in as Liman's forces could not push the Allies back into the sea as they began entrenching themselves
	- Trench conditions grew increasingly unsanitary as both human and animal corpses went uncollected in No Man's Land and disease spread
- The Turks launched an attack on May 19 with 42,000 men against 17,000, intending to push the Anzac into the sea
	- However, the Anzac were well positioned and prepared to cut down this attack, causing 10,000 casualties in 6 hours (626 Anzac casualties)
		- On May 24, a temporary truce was agreed in order for the Turks to collect and bury their dead in No Man's Land
	- In the coming months, Liman would grow his reinforcements core to 14 divisions
- With minimal ground gained, a new front would attempt to be opened with the [[Suvla Bay]] landings in August of 1915

Significance
- Landing in unison with Cape Helles, Anzac Cove would be hotly contested for months, with failed attempts to break out in late August
