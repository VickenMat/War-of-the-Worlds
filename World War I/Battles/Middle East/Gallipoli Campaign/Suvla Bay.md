Suvla Landing, August 1915

- By August of [[1915]], the British and [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] had established two beachheads, without much advance, at [[Anzac Cove]] and [[Cape Helles]] as part of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]
- Beginning on August 6 1915 and known as the "August Offensive", the Allies used their fresh reinforcements to launch attacks at Sulva Bay, north of Anzac Cove in an attempt to break out of the stalemate
- Hamilton instructed [[Aylmer Hunter-Weston]] of Cape Helles to strike and [[William Birdwood]] of Anzac Cove to seize the Sari Bair Ridge with 25,000 reinforcements smuggled into the area
- The capture of Sari Bair was crucial if the Allies were to gain control of the central heights of the peninsula
	- Liman received word from Berlin that an offensive was likely in August, so he split his 14 divisions up at Helles, Anzac Cove, Kum Kale, and the Bulair area
		- He did not send any to Sulva Bay, which at the time only held 1,500 troops
- In command of the landings was [[Sir Frederick Stopford]], a general who was nearing retirement and had no battle experience
	- 20,000 Allied troops landed at 'A', 'B', and 'C' Beaches with no Turkish opposition
	- Rather than immediately advancing after the landings as instructed, Stopford consolidated his position unaware of how weak the Turkish defense truly was
- Learning where the real invasion was, Liman appointed [[Mustafa Kemal]] to command the sector and deployed 5 divisions to Suvla Bay
- By August 9, when the British attack was picking up momentum, Kemal secured the Tekke Tepe Ridge (which was ordered to be quickly taken) and surrounded the Allies by taking advantage of high ground and reinforcements
- The Allies suffered 18,000 casualties and trench warfare set in at Suvla Bay, as it had in Helles and Anzac Cove

Significance
- In an attempt to break out of the stalemate, the Allies attempted to create a new front at Suvla Bay to connect with troops at Anzac Cove
- The offensive lost momentum due to human capital and indecisiveness
