April [[1915]] landing

- In early 1915, the Allies were deadlocked with Germany on [[Western Front]] and [[Russia]] was struggling in the east
- [[Winston Churchill]], the political head of the Royal Navy and aspiring military strategist, would be the Gallipoli invasion's chief advocate
	- Believed taking Constantinople to link the Mediterranean and Black Sea, allowing for a clear sea supply route to [[Russia]]
	- Britain's war cabinet backed the plan, though with less troops than Churchill desired
	- British, French, and untested Australian and New Zealand forces would be taken into battle
- The Dardanelles Straight leads to the Turkish capital of Constantinople (Istanbul), but the was heavily fortified with minefields, fortifications, and gun emplacements
	- In February and March, the failure of naval forces to destroy these defenses (Alerting the Ottomans and eliminating the element of surprise) forced the Allies to send troops to seize the peninsula
- In wake of the failed naval attack, on April 25 1915, [[General Sir Ian Hamilton]] landed the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (Anzac) near Gaba Tepe at Ari Burnu (now known as [[Anzac Cove]]) and the British 29th Division at [[Cape Helles]]
	- Success would require a quick victory
- Opposing him was German officer [[Liman von Sanders]] who held a force of 84,000 Turkish troops
	- **Goal** of the campaign
		- Seize and pass through the Dardanelles to allow navy ships to attack Constantinople
		- Open supply lines to Russia by linking the Mediterranean and Black Sea
		- Strengthen the Allied Middle East
		- Knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war
- Cape Helles Landing
	- Led by [[Aylmer Hunter-Weston]], the British Division made 5 beach landings at Cape Helles
		- Y Beach was originally undefended and captured, but later evacuated after Ottoman reinforcements arrived
		- W and V Beaches saw heavy British casualties due to barbed wire and heavily defended Ottoman positions
		- V Beach faced heavy machine gun fire from the Sedd-el-Bahr fortress
			- Only 21 of 200 men made it ashore
		- S Beach was taken shortly
	- Ultimately, the British offensive at Helles came at a massive human cost for little gain
- Anzac Cove Landing
	- Led by [[William Birdwood]], the goal was to take the Sari Bair Range and once in control, move across the peninsula to cut off the southern half and prevent Ottoman reinforcements
	- Although unopposed at Anzac Cove, the mismanagement of landing zones led to steep cliff climbing to reach the heights which allowed for Ottoman reinforcements
		- [[Mustafa Kemal]] of the Ottomans personally led the 57th Regiment 
	- Fighting, particularly at Anzac cove, soon turned into a trench warfare stalemate, similar to the Western Front
- Throughout the campaign, the **Allies could not advance against the higher-positioned Turks and the Turks could not force the Allies back into the sea**
- August Offensive
	- Launched on August 6 at [[Suvla Bay]] to break the deadlock at Anzac Cove and Cape Helles
	- [[Battle of Chunuk Bair]] commenced north of Anzac cove, near the hills of Chunuk Bair
	- [[Battle of Lone Pine]] was a diversionary attack that saw a minor victory in capturing trenches but brought more Turk reserves north 
	- [[Battle of Krithia Vineyard]] was a failed attempt to divert Ottoman attention from the [[Battle of Sari Bair]]
	- The offensive as a whole slowed and lost momentum by August 10 due to stiff Turkish resistance and indecisive Allied command
	- In late August the [[Battle of Scimitar Hill]] and [[Battle of Hill 60]] were launched as last ditch attempts to break out of Anzac Cove
	- The Suvla Bay landings had failed and the front had returned to stalemate
- The Allies were trapped at Helles, Anzac, and Suvla Bay, all of which were overlooked by high ground and under artillery and infantry fire
	- Casualties were heavy, the summer heat pounded on the soldiers, disease was rampant, and food became inedible, and swarms of corpse flies surrounded them
- By November, it was clear the stalemate would not be broken and in late December/early January [[1916]], the Anzacs were withdrawn from Gallipoli with minimal losses
	- Hamilton was dismissed and replaced because he opposed a withdrawal, fearing the loss of prestige
	- The Allies evacuated 105,000 men and 300 guns from Anzac Cove and Suvla Bay and 35,000 men from Cape Helles
- In the aftermath, each side suffered roughly 250,000 casualties with 46,000 Allied and 65,000 Turkish troops dead

Significance
- Goal was to seize control of the Dardanelles Straight to have access to Constantinople and **link** the Mediterranean Sea with the Black Sea, which would have given France and Britain a direct supply line to Russia
- The offensive was considered a disaster from the Allied perspective and rejuvenated the Ottoman war effort
- Churchill, fairly or unfairly was considered the scapegoat
- A supply line for Russia would not be established and the new front to undercut the Central Powers would fail to exist

Aftermath
- Many historians believe the campaign was ill-advised, poorly executed, and had little to no significance on the total war effort
	- Even if Constantinople had been lost, there is no evidence that the Ottoman Empire would have been knocked out of the war
- A benefit to Australian troops as it kept them away from the Western Front
