Beach landings at Cape Helles, April [[1915]]

- On April 25, [[1915]], [[General Sir Ian Hamilton]] led [[Great Britain]] and its empire into simultaneous beach landings at Anzac Cove and [[Cape Helles]] as part of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]
- Opposing him was [[Liman von Sanders]], a German officer and 84,000 Turkish troops from the [[Ottoman Empire]] to be spent throughout the region
- The attack was poorly managed by [[Aylmer Hunter-Weston]]
- Landings were to be made at five locations, named 'Y', 'X', 'W', 'V', and 'S' beaches, consisting of 35,000 men
- While smaller French forces created diversion landings at Kum Kale, the Ottoman defenders at Helles held their positions well
- 'W' and 'V' Beaches came under heavy Turkish machine gun fire
- 'Y', 'X', and 'S' Beaches were secured quickly but Hunter-Weston chose to hold those positions rather than push forward and attack the remainder of the defending forces
	- Labeled a mismanagement of the situation, there was vague directive stating that the landings were to be giving the highest priority rather than advancing
- Although both the Anzac Cove and Cape Helles landings had been achieved, advances had not been made in the first day
	- Stalemate had set in as Liman's forces could not push the Allies back into the sea as they began entrenching themselves
- Advances were later attempted in the Battles of Krithia in April, May, and June, all of which failed and incurred a heavy human cost
- With minimal ground gained, a new front would attempt to be opened at [[Suvla Bay]] in August of 1915

Significance
- Mismanaged and unorganized, the trench warfare at Cape Helles would ensue for months until the eventual evacuation of the peninsula
