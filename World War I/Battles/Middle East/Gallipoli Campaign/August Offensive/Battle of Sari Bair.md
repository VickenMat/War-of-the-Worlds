Sari Bair Offensive, August 6 [[1915]]

- Beginning of the "August Offensive" and also known as the "Battle of the Nek", the Battle of Sari Bair represented a final [[Great Britain]] attempt at taking control of the peninsula
- With two fronts established at [[Cape Helles]] (massive casualties for little territorial gain) and [[Anzac Cove]] (stalemate trench warfare), the British began a new campaign to capture the Sari Bair Ridge
	- The Sari Bair Ridge was the high ground which overlooked the middle of the peninsula above Anzac cove
- Success at capturing the Sari Bair Ridge was crucial for the Allies to gain control of the central heights as its panoramic view would prevent its use by the Turks in defending the Suvla Bay landings 
- The [[Ottoman Empire]] anticipated a breakout from Anzac Cove would come, but were unsure if it was to the north at [[Suvla Bay]] or south at Gabe Tepe
- [[General Sir Ian Hamilton]], commander of the [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]], now armed with the 10th, 11th, 13th, 53rd, and 54th divisions, led the attack
- The Allied **attack was directed at two summits**; Chunuk Bair and Hill 971, both of which were expected to be captured by dawn of August 6
	- As a distraction, an attack was launched on August 6 at the [[Battle of Lone Pine]] and [[Battle of Krithia Vineyard]], resulting in the capture of Ottoman trenches and a struggle over meaningless land respectively
		- This however, attracted more reinforcements to the north, ultimately hampering the Suvla Bay landings
- [[Battle of Chunuk Bair]] saw a short lived capture of the summit on August 7
- The division tasted with taking Hill 971 became lost and never got close to their objective
	- British forces launched an attack from the wrong location, mistaken about their position relative to Hill 971
- On August 10, after being pushed off of Chunuk Bair by a large Ottoman counter-attack, the fighting subdued to find that although there were more Turkish casualties (9,000 - 20,000) than British (12,000) while the Allies had not achieved any of their territorial goals
- The combination of insufficient terrain knowledge, disease, and lack of numbers caused a retreat from the area and a large number of casualties 

Significance
- Beginning of the "August Offensive"
- Effort to break up the stalemate at Anzac Cove and Cape Helles failed
- The holder of the Sari Bair Ridge has a panoramic view of its surround area, including Suvla Bay
- Effectively ended Allied plans to break out of Anzac Cove after retreating
