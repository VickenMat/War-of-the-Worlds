Allies and Turkish trenches, August 29 [[1915]]

- Conducted by [[William Birdwood]] as a part of the August Offensive, the Battle of Hill 60 was an attempt to support a larger attack at the [[Battle of Scimitar Hill]]
- Similar to the Battle of Scimitar Hill, this was a last ditch attempt to break north out of [[Anzac Cove]] and link up with Allied forced at [[Suvla Bay]]
	- Hill 60 was named after its height in meters, as was often the case with war naming convention
- By this time, Birdwood's forces were diminished and could only hold 3,000 soldiers
	- Reconnaissance also proved problematic and insufficient
- While attacking the hill, Turkish machine guns rained fire and incurred 2,500 British casualties
	- Birdwood abandoned the attack on August 29

Significance
- Last ditch effort along with the Battle of Scimitar Hill to break out of Anzac Cove
- Its capture would allow for safe communications between Allied sectors
- Another Allied retreat
