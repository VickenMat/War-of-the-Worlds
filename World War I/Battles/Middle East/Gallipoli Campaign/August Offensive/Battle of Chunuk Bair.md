Battle of Chunuk Bair, [[1915]]

- On August 7 1915, [[General Sir Ian Hamilton]] launched a [[Great Britain]] (British Empire) assault on the hills of Chunuk Bair, north of Anzac cove in order to break the stalemate the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] had turned into and secure the Sari Bair Range to capture the high ground
- Fought between the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (British Empire) and the [[Ottoman Empire]] as part of the August Offensive
- British planned to land infantry at Suvla Bay (5 miles north of [[Anzac Cove]]), followed by an advance on Sari Bair Range
- The Ottoman command, did not expect an attack at Chunuk Bair as they felt the rugged terrain made it unsuitable, but [[Mustafa Kemal]] (commander of the section) anticipated one
	- Kemal was unable to convince his superiors to strengthen the defenses here
	- The Anzac units were still met with well entrenched machine guns as they made their way up the ridge clearing outposts at Rhododendron Spur
- On August 8, in danger of being overrun, heavy Ottoman and German reinforcements arrived at the summit of Chunuk Bair (from 20 sleeping soldiers to 500 in a matter of hours)
	- The 7th Glosters and Wellington battalions, supported by machine guns and naval bombardment made it up to Chunuk Bair easily, as the Ottoman defenders could not entrench in the rocky ground
- However, Chunuk Bair was difficult to defend (rocky surface did not allow for deep entrenchment and exposure from different hills) and only an hour later, an Ottoman counterattack began
	- The slope of the hill was so steep that the Ottomans could get within 20 meters of the trenches without being seen
- On August 10, an Ottoman counterattack using sheer numbers overran and massacred the Anzacs and took the slope back
- The brief capture of Chunuk Bair was the only success during the Gallipoli Campaign, but its fall led to the eventual evacuation of British Empire troops from the peninsula

- Significance
	- The loss of Chunuk Bair marked the eventual end of the [[Battle of Sari Bair]] and August Offensive
	- Gallipoli Campaign was effectively over
