Scimitar Hill and Hill 60 attack plans, August 21 [[1915]]

- Led by the British 29th Division on August 21 [[1915]], the Battle of Scimitar Hill was the largest and final assault by the Allies during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]
- Launched in unison with [[Battle of Hill 60]]
- Goal of the attack was to remove the [[Ottoman Empire]] from the Suvla landing and and link with [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] in the south
- Success at Scimitar Hill would link [[Suvla Bay]] and [[Anzac Cove]]
- Scimitar Hill, named for its curved summit was briefly captured, but the attackers were subsequently driven away as defensive fire from the Turks rained down from a higher position
- British reinforcements in the 2nd Mounted Division helped them take the hill for a second time, but it was shortly lost again
- British had 5,300 casualties out of the 14,300 while the Turks had 2,600 casualties

Significance
- Largest and final offensive during the Gallipoli Campaign prior to evacuation in early [[1916]]
- Considered a last ditch effort by the Allies
