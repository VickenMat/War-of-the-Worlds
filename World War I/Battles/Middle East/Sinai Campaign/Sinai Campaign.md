Sinai Campaign, [[1916]]

- Primarily fought between the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] of [[Great Britain]] and its territories against the German led [[Ottoman Empire]] operating in Palestine
- The goal was for control and security of the Suez Canal
- The Turks only a few routes they could take from Palestine to Egypt across the arid terrain of the Sinai Peninsula, restricting their travel to close to the Mediterranean
- The [[Defense of Suez Canal]] began on February 3 [[1915]] after the Ottomans dragged equipment through 160km of desert 
	- The attack was poorly coordinated and repulsed the Turks back into the Sinai desert
	- Subsequently, the British pushed their defenses out 10km expecting another attack
	- The EEF also destroyed wells and waterholes, limiting a future enemy advance across the desert
- If the British were to push the Turks all the way back to Palestine, they would need an efficient method to cross the desert
	- In February 1916 construction began on a railway and water pipeline
	- Although the railway was operable during construction, the water pipeline wasn't
		- The Egyptian Camel Transport Corps aided water, food, and medical supply transportation along the railway
- The beginning of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] limited British supplies while also depriving the Turks the ability to renew an offensive
	- However, the end of the Gallipoli Campaign in December 1915 now altered the military situation as the Turks had troops available to launch a new attack on the canal
	- Defeat at Gallipoli ended British hopes of a quick victory over the Ottomans
- On April 23 1916, the Turks destroyed outposts along the defensive line formed between El Arish and Kossaima
- The [[Battle of Romani]], fought from August 3-5 heralded the second attempt on Suez Canal beginning in mid July 1916 
	- Although outnumbering the British, the Turks were again defeated and fell into retreat
- Fighting continued until [[1917]] when Turkish defenses around Magdhaba and Rafa were captured by the British, completing the Allied occupation of the Sinai Peninsula


Significance
- Defending the Suez Canal would require manpower, which the British had lost much of after the Gallipoli Campaign and [[Western Front]]
- A railway and water pipeline was created stretching from the canal the Palestine
- The Turkish loss at the Battle of Romani marked the end of the attacks on the canal
- Pushing the Turks back opened up the Palestine front
