Romani Defenses August 3, [[1916]]

- The Battle of Romani was part of the larger [[Sinai Campaign]], and primarily the [[Defense of Suez Canal]] which aimed to secure the Canal against the danger of Ottoman attack
- The Allied railway and water pipeline was making steady progress, allowing them to move forward
	- The German Chief of Staff on the Ottoman VIII Corps set in motion an offensive with the objective of destroying the railroad and defenses
	- To proceed, they collected the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] battle hardened Ottoman 3rd Infantry and batteries of German and Austrian heavy artillery
		- However, the size of the force meant it would make a slow and unsurprising crawl towards the British through the desert
		- In areas of soft sand, wooden planks resembling makeshift roads were set up to move the heavy guns
	- Allied reconnaissance easily detected their path and reinforced their positions around Romani
	- It would take two weeks for the Ottomans to cross the desert
- Lasting from August 3rd to the 5th 1916, the [[Ottoman Empire]] faced not only the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade but also the harsh and isolated conditions of the the Sinai Peninsula
- On the night of August 3, the Turks attempted to outflank Romani from the south
	- Turkish infantry and Australian Light Horse troops shot and bayoneted each other in the darkness, and the Allies were pushed back
	- Throughout the day of the 4th however, British infantry and mounted reinforcements steadily arrived and launched an attack around a massive dune known as the Mount Royston
	- The Turkish resistance, in the open with no natural cover, collapsed and retreated
- This put an end to the Ottoman Empire's threat at the [[Defense of Suez Canal]] and marked the beginning of [[Great Britain]]'s drive out of Egypt and into Palestine

- The Battle of Romani saw 1,130 Allied and 5,000 Ottoman casualties
	- 4,000 of those casualties were taken prisoner
	- The Anzac division took the brunt of the losses

Significance
- The battle led to the eventual Ottoman retreat to Palestine
