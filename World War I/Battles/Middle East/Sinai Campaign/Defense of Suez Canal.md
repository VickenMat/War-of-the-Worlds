Suez Canal during the [[Sinai Campaign]], [[1916]]

- [[1915]] saw World War 1 spread to the Middle East, particularly Egypt and Palestine
- The Suez Canal was the quickest naval route between Europe and the Indian and Pacific Ocean
	- In short, **[[Great Britain]] and her colonies**
	- Controlled by the British in early 1915
- [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Germany]] led the [[Suez Expeditionary Force]], a group of 25,000 soldiers, to seize the Suez Canal
	- However, road and rail would be unusable to access the canal, only a 300km march would do
	- The march across the desert would be planned around the rainy season and need to be completed in two months
	- Once at the canal, the Turks would have only four days worth of supplies before having to return
- The British deployed 30,000 [[Indian Expeditionary Force]] (IEF) troops in its defense
- The Turkish attack was heavily reliant on a surprise attack, but British reconnaissance had warned the Allies in advance
- On February 2 1915, The Ottoman forces were repelled by the IEF, and after losing 2,000 men compared to the 150 Allied casualties, retreated
- This would be the only Turkish offensive on the canal

Significance
- The Suez Canal was vital for British supply lines
- A successful Allied defense denied the only Turkish attempt at the canal
- The only positive for the Central Powers was that although they never again attacked, the British spent a large amount of troops defending it, which could have better been used during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]
