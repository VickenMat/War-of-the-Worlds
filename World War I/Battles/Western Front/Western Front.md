- By the end of [[1914]], both sides had entrenched themselves and stalemate kicked in
- The line from the Swiss Border to the Belgian Coast was called the Western Front
	- The expanse in between opposing trenches was called [[No Man's Land]]
		- No Man's Land was protected by barbed wire, artillery, and heavy machine gun fire
- The challenge was how to get your men out of the muddy, waterlogged trenches across No Man's Land and into enemy territory without getting mowed down by machine guns or artillery
