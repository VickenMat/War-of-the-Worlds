- On April 27 [[1916]], near the village of Hulluch in northern [[France]], [[Germany]] would launch what would be their most concentrated gas attack of the war on the Irish
- The gas attacks of Hulluch are relatively unknown and its significance is often overlooked due to the situation back in Dublin - the Easter Risings - which were disappointingly received on the Irish lines
- The Great War saw the emergence of [[Chemical Warfare]] and it terrified a soldier more than any other weapon
- [[Sir John French]] of the [[British Expeditionary Force]] would call the use of poison gas "a cynical and barbarous disregard of the well-known usages of civilized war"
- Hulluch was a terrible reminder of its ability to kill, injure, and demoralize soldiers

Gas attack during World War 1

- Following the [[Battle of Loos]] where the British used chemical warfare for the first time, both sides were aware of the indiscriminate slaughter it can cause
- On the morning of April 27 1916 the German Army sent a barrage of machine gun fun and heavy artillery, followed by 3,800 cylinders of chlorine and phosgene gas to drift across [[No Man's Land]]

- As Colonel Edward Bellingham describes it, "A dense cloud of black gas and smoke" settled over the Irish lines
	- The effects were so intense that gas masks had to be worn three miles behind the frontline
- Although most of the casualties were caused by the subsequent German bombardment, the gas reduced the Irish visibility enough for Germans to storm enemy lines and engage in hand to hand combat
- Not only did the British have faulty gas masks, but the gas was so strong it penetrated beyond them anyway
	- Production of the Small Box Respirator was accelerated following this discovery
- Germany knew the situation back home in Ireland
	- They held up makeshift placard saying "Irishmen! Heavy uproar in Ireland. "English guns are firing at your wives and children." in a vain attempt to turn Irishmen against their fellow soldiers

Significance
- Most concentrated German gas attack in the war
- Heavy Irish casualties for little German ground gained
