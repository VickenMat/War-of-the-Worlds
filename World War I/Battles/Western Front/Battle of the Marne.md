- In anticipation of another German attack, newly appointed French military governor [[General Joseph Simon Gallieni]] received an army - [[Manoury's 6th Army]] to defend the capital
	- Germans within 30 miles of Paris
- On the German side, [[General Alexander von Kluck]], head of the German 1st Army, disobeyed orders to double back and support the 2nd Army, which would have protected its flank from the direction of Paris
	- Kluck ordered his army to pursue the retreating French army across the Marne River
- Hearing of this move, [[General Joseph Simon Gallieni]], he ordered his new army of Paris to attack the undefended German flank
- 150,000 soldiers from the French 6th Army marched on the German 1st Army's right flank
- On September 9, the Germans were pushed back from the River Marne to the River Aisne (as seen in the map below), where the Allies would maintain a foothold in until [[1918]]
- The retreat ended German plans plans of a two-front war strategy, also called the [[Schlieffen Plan]], making it one of the most decisive battles in the war
- Significance
	- Although the Allies gained a foothold on Northern France, Battle of the Marne truly meant that this would not be a short conflict, but that the war would go on
	- There was no turning back as all nations involved were caught in a trap with no exit
