- October 19 [[1914]]
- The Belgian city of Ypres had been a battle site throughout history due to its strategic location leading to the Channel ports in Flanders
- Following the [[Battle of the Marne]], in October 1914, the "Race to the Sea" began
- The "Race to the Sea", ending at the North Sea coast was vital as both sides attempted to  outflank the other
	- The area around the North Sea contained the "last gap" through which either side could launch a decisive attack
	- Both sides built fortifications and trenches along their way up
- After [[Germany]] captured the Belgian city of Antwerp in early October, the defending [[British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) withdrew to Ypres
- Germany prepared their offensive on Ypres and other channel ports in order to control the North Sea
- On October 19, the Germans opened their Flanders offensive, seeing heavy Allied resistance
	- It became apparent that trench warfare favored the defenders rather than attackers
- Fierce combat prevailed until November 22, when winter would force the battle to pause
- The area between the two forces became known as the Ypres Salient, which would be some of the most bitter fighting

Significance
- Germany attempting to seize the North Sea and English Channel, had to go through the Allies at Ypres
- First of three battles
- British and French would hold Ypres until the end of the war, despite repeated German attacks
