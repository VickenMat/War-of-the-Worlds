Map of the Battle of Verdun, 1916

- [[Germany]], and General [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] believed the war would be won or lost in France and  that a breakthrough wasn't possible on the Western Front so instead for a the strategy of attrition with limited advance in the Verdun area
	- By taking important French territory, they hoped to instigate larger scale counter attacks who would then fall to massed German artillery
	- Ultimately the German goal was to either **return to mobile warfare** or negotiate a political settlement to "bleed the French white."
	- The location of Verdun was chosen because its position threatened main German communication lines and that it had great psychological hold on the mind of the French
	- Germany believed the British to be the Allies most formidable power, and their "**real weapons**" were the French, Russian, and Italian Army
		- Russia had been paralyzed and Italy was hardly able to effect the outcome of the war
		- "Only France remains"
		- Should France have been defeated, British would most likely seek terms or subsequently fall
	- The idea of the German offensive was a **continuous** series of limited advances that would draw the French reserves into the mincing machine that was German artillery
- On February 21 [[1916]], Germany began bombardment on a front nearly 25 miles long
	- Nicknamed "The Mill on the Meuse"; Verdun would last for nearly ten months
	- They would capture the normally well-defended high ground of Fort Douaumont without firing a shot on February 25 and overrun the first line of French defenses

- The French organizes a motorized supply chain of unprecedented scale called the "Sacred Way"; which was the only route taking men and munitions up to the battlefield
	- In all, carried 4,000 trucks, 2,000 cars, 800 ambulances, 200 buses and many vans
	- Ran from Bar-le-Duc to Verdun
- [[France]] and Germany would find themselves in a war of attrition that wore them both down
	- Germany intended this to be a "meat grinder" drawing more French into it as it raged on
	- The French had to deal with the predicament of holding Verdun without ceasing to prepare for the Somme
- On March 6, Germany attacked the River Meuse but were unable to breach French lines
- In order to relive the pressure on France, the [[Battle of the Somme]] was launched on July 1 1916 with the addition of [[Great Britain]]
	- The French would still be used here but in a reduces role
- In the autumn of 1916, the French launched a counter-attack, capturing the German held Fort Douaumont (October 24) and Vaux (November 2)

- The French had reclaimed almost all the land they lost since the beginning of the defense and on December 18 1916, the Battle of Verdun had ended
- There were a total of 700,000 casualties including 300,000 killed
	- French casualties exceeded 370,000 while Germany sustained nearly 330,000
	- 3/4 of the French Army fought at Verdun
	- Surrounding villages such as Beaumont, Bezonvaux, Cumieres, Douaumont, Fleury, Haumont, Louvemont, Ornes, and Vaux were left in ruin
	- Near 65 square miles on the Verdun Ridge were declared Zone Rouge, or "Red Zone" due to all the unexploded bombs and development in the area was prohibited

Significance
- The German goal of Verdun was the return to mobile warfare and limited advances which slowly drew in French reserves (intended war of attrition)
- The battle took place at the French fortress of Verdun because its surrounding fortifications along the River Meuse threatened German communication lines
- The loss of Verdun would have been a major blow to French morale
- Verdun was the longest and one the the bloodiest battles of the war
- It summed up every aspect of the Great War due to its brutality, minimal gains with enormous human capital
- The French had repulsed a major German offensive
