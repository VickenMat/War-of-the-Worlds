Trench map of Loos offensive, [[1915]]

- On September 25 1915, [[Great Britain]] and [[France]] launched a joint offensive on the [[Western Front]] in Loos and Champagne/Artois respectively
- Led by [[Sir John French]], commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force]]
- The British had condemned [[Germany]] for their use of chemical warfare since the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] but in searching for a way to break through decided on using it themselves at Loos
	- The gas was released from cylinders by special units an hour before the infantry attacked
	- Due to fickle weather, some of the gas blew back into their trenches and lingered in [[No Man's Land]], causing confusion
	- As quoted by British Second Lieutenant George Grossman in his letter, "The gas hung in a thick pall over everything, and it was impossible to see more than ten yards. In vain I looked for my landmarks in the German line, to guide me to the right spot, but I could not see through the gas"

- The British took heavy casualties due to crossing through uncut barbed wire, but had still broken through enemy positions by the end of the first day
- However, supply, communication, and reinforcement issues did not allow for the breakthrough to be exploited and had to be halted
- By September 28, the Germans pushed them all the way back to their starting points
- [[Sir John French]] was forced to resign following the battle and was replaced by [[General Sir Douglas Haig]]
- 50,000 total British casualties with 2,600 as a result of the failed gas of whom very few died
	- Germans suffered nearly 25,000 casualties

- The poem "My Boy Jack" written by author Rudyard Kipling showed themes of loss about this battle
	- "Have you news of my boy Jack?, Not this tide. When d'you think that he'll come back? Not with this wind blowing, and this tide."

Significance
- Largest British offensive at the time
- First British use of poison gas (in an attempt to end stalemate)
- Showed that piercing through German lines was possible, but not so easy to convert this success into a major breakthrough
