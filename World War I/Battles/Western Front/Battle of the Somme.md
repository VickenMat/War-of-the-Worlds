New Zealand on the Somme [[1916]]

- The Battle of the Somme began as an Allied offensive against [[Germany]] in the hopes of bringing relief to the French soldiers fighting at the [[Battle of Verdun]]
	- It was fought along the Somme River in France
- On June 24, 1916, [[Great Britain]] led by [[General Sir Douglas Haig]] began their artillery barrage which was expected to destroy German defenses and barbed wire, allowing them to walk right over [[No Man's Land]] and occupy German trenches
	- Although firing 1.75 million shells, it was largely ineffective due to most of it being shrapnel, which couldn't penetrate through concrete dugouts - 30% of shells also failed to explode
- On July 1 1916, British and French launched a major offensive on the Somme to relieve the pressure being put on the French troops at the [[Battle of Verdun]]
	- 11 divisions of the British 4th Army-many of whom were volunteer soldiers with very little battle experience and 5 French divisions advanced onto the River Somme where German defenses were waiting
	- Many British soldiers were gunned down by a storm of machine gun fire resulting in a miserable first day with 60,000 casualties
	- However, moving south the line, other divisions had been more successful

Irish 103rd Brigade advance on La Boisselle, July 1 1916 

- On July 15, the British attacked and captured Longueval Ridge, catching the Germans by surprise
	- By the end of July 160,000 and 200,000 German and Allied soldiers would lose their lives respectively
- The struggle for Delville Wood would become a slogging match lasting for months
	- On July 14 1916, the 1st South African Brigade, 3,153 officers and men entered Delville Wood, with only 750 coming out unscathed
	- Delville Wood was nicknamed "Devil's Wood" by the Allies

Abandoned German trench in Delville Wood, September 1916

- In late August, [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and [[Erich Ludendorff]] took control of high command and marked a change in German strategy - building a new defensive line behind the Somme front and conceding territory to allow more damage when Allied soldiers advance
- On September 15 1916, the British used 48 Mark I tanks in battle for the first time to advance around 1.5 miles but without breaking through
	- Many tanks broke down before reaching the front line as this was their first ever appearance
- The Allies would end with "victory" over the Somme, despite its horrific costs because they inflicted serious damage to German positions in France, causing them to strategically retreat to the [[Hindenburg Line]] in March [[1917]]
- On November 18 1916, with the arrival of winter looming and conditions already terrible, [[General Sir Douglas Haig]] shut down the offensive
	- British suffered more than 57,000 casualties, with more than 19,000 soldiers killed on the first day
	- By the end of the battle, more than 3 million soldiers had fought and more than 1 million had been killed or wounded


Significance
- The battle turned into one of the most bitter, deadly, and costly engagements in human history
- Would be remembered as the epitome of brutal and senseless carnage that characterized trench warfare
- The Allies would claim victory despite the horrid human capital, forcing the Germans to strategically retreat to the [[Hindenburg Line]] in March 1917
