- April 22, [[1915]]
- The second battle of Ypres was the only offensive the [[Germany]] launched in 1915
- Beginning of the modern era of chemical warfare
	- The usual bombardment of artillery fire started the attack, but after it finished, Allied troops were expecting German troops to attack
	- Instead, Germany fired north of 150 tons of lethal chlorine gas against [[France]] troops at Ypres in [[Belgium]]
	- The gas wiped out both French divisions but the Germans were unable to take advantage as they were shocked by its devastating effects
- Chemical warfare was sparingly used previously, but not effectively or on a large scale
- A second chemical attack against the [[Canada]] division on April 24 forced them to retreat to the town of Ypres
- Mustard gas was introduced by the Germans in [[1917]], killing thousands
- In total, 100,000 tons of chemical weapons were used in the war, injuring 500,000 troops and killing 30,000

- Significance
	- Ultimately, the battle saw insignificant territorial gains or losses, but the introduction of poison gas would have devastating effects throughout the war
	- Both sides would eventually deploy gas masks and protective clothing, rending the poison gas ineffective
