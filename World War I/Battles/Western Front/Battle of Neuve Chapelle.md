Neuve Chapelle, [[1915]]

- The battles of [[1914]] were classified as encounter battles, meaning unforeseen events occurred and commanders were meant to react
	- The notion of "It will be over by Christmas" was met with the reality of modern warfare in early 1915
	- Commanders faced the challenge of getting their men across [[No Man's Land]] without getting gunned down by machine guns or artillery
- [[Great Britain]] Field Marshall [[Sir John French]], commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force]] intended to lead a major effort to bring an early victory to the war
	- This effort was an attack on German lines at Neuve Chapelle, in the flat lands of northern [[France]] by the [[Belgium]] border
	- The idea was to advance beyond the Neuve Chapelle village to the higher grounds of Aubers Ridge, which would then threaten the German held city of Lille
		- Aubers Ridge was strategically important launching point for future attacks on Lille
		- Lille was a **major German transport hub** for soldiers moving north to south along the [[Western Front]], and its capture would interfere with communication and transport lines
	- Entirely a British affair because the French didn't have any troops to spare from the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]
- Advances in aerial reconnaissance were made during the battle, with command being able to pin point enemy positions and drawing trench maps
- After careful preparation, the battle began on March 10 1915 with the largest concentration of British artillery (to date) on German front lines
	- Whistles were blown, and in conjunction with the [[Indian Army]], infantry charged onto the village, devastating the Germans in close quarter combat
		- However, there was a portion of the attack that did not see the artillery destroy the barbed wire, leading to a slaughter of the advancing British regiment
	- Despite this, the now city of debris was cleared by house to house combat and then captured on March 10 1915
- It came at a large cost in terms of casualties
	- British - 544 officers and 11,108 soldiers killed, wounded, or missing
	- German - 12,000 casualties including 1,687 prisoners

Significance
- The Battle of Neuve Chapelle was the **first** large scale offensive against an entrenched enemy by the British Army in the war
- First effective use of artillery, infantry, and aerial reconnaissance working cohesively
	- Photographing enemy positions from the sky and relaying it to commanders was being experimented
- It showed that it was possible to break into enemy positions but not necessarily through them
	- Good artillery observation points were few and far between
	- Reserves were too slow in following up
	- Command communications took too long 
		- Means of communication were too vulnerable
- Led to the [[Battle of Aubers Ridge]] and [[Vimy Ridge]]
