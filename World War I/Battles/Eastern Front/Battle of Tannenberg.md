- Fought on the [[Eastern Front]] in Tannenberg, East Prussia between [[Germany]] and [[Russia]]
- Russians had more than a two-to-one superiority against the Germans 
- [[General Yakov Grigoryevich Zhilinsky]], chief of general staff of Russia until 1914, had made an arrangement with [[France]] where they would have 800,000 men in the field by the 15th day of mobilization

- The Battle of Tannenberg would be Germany's most greatest victory against Russia

- Significance
