Northeastern Europe, [[1914]]

- **Background**, Spring 1915
- The situation of the Central Powers in Spring of [[1915]] was critical, with losses during the summer/autumn battles compounded with the Carpathian Winter War
	- The Habsburg Empire was expected to collapse under the next attack
	- With a damaged reputation due to a retreat to Russian hands in 1914, [[Italy]] and [[Romania]] threatened to flip from neutral and join the Allies to benefit from their impending doom
	- Although more successful against [[Russia]] during the [[Battle of Tannenberg]], [[Germany]] was still engaged in a two front war, meaning it would only be a matter of time before they became stretched too thin
- Russia had recovered from considerable losses in battles in 1914 and 1915, and believed they were in better strategic positions in Spring of 1915 
	- They had turned their attention to the southern part of the Eastern Front, hoping to break Austria-Hungary and knock the Habsburg Empire out of the war
- Initially planned as a minor offensive from [[Germany]] to relieve pressure on [[Austria-Hungary]] from [[Russia]] to their south on the [[Eastern Front]]
- **Goals**
	- The Habsburg Empire's goal was to reclaim lost territory to convince Italy and Romania to stay neutral due to military strength
	- Germany aimed to crush the Russian Army and remove them from contention in the Eastern Front, while also keeping Austria-Hungary in the war effort
- The region of Tarnow in Poland was chosen because its railways facilitated fast deployment of troops and material
- Beginning May 2 [[1915]], the Central Powers opened heavy artillery fire with howitzers and mortars
	- The Russian fortifications were "more ditches than trenches"
	- "The ground trembled, hell seemed to be let loose"
	- Neighboring towns and villages, churches, houses, and industrial plants were destroyed, with only 10% of its buildings inhabitable
- 220,000 officers and soldiers along with 900 artillery on the Central Powers' side faced off against inexperienced Russian soldiers with no artillery
- Although initially putting up stiff resistance, the Russians were quickly overwhelmed
	- 40,000 Central Powers' troops swept through 10km of enemy land while Russia rallied to collect scattered troops as reinforcements to re-establish a line of defense
- Russia was isolated, outflanked, and swiftly defeated, causing a full retreat on June 15 1915
	- 100,000 Russian casualties, with 250,000 captured as prisoners
	- 90,000 German and Austro-Hungarian casualties
- With the Russian Army in retreat, the Habsburg Empire could transport troops to the Italian Front


Significance
- Germany and Austria-Hungary who waged war independently so far, reluctantly agreed to join forces on a campaign in the Eastern Front
- Beginning as a minor attack, ended as the chief Central Powers' success of 1915 - accomplishing all objectives in less time than expected
- Caused a total collapse of Russian supply lines and their retreat far into Russia
	- Neutralized the Tsarist Army as a fighting for for months considering the losses of territory, soldiers, and war materials
- Although the success, Vienna and Berlin went back to  waging war **independently**
