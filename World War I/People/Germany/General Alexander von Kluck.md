- Head of the German 1st Army in [[1914]]
- After attacking [[Belgium]] and Northern [[France]], Kluck disobeyed his headquarters orders to double back and support the German 2nd Army's right flank, or attacks from Paris
- Instead the German 1st Army ordered the pursuit of the retreating French Army across the Marne River
- This blunder allowed [[General Joseph Simon Gallieni]] to attack the German right flank from Paris in the [[Battle of the Marne]]
- The Germans would later retreat and never cross it again
