Preface
- The start of WWII is shrouded in confusion across the globe - each combatant has their own entry point
	- In [[China]] and [[Japan]], the war is said to have begun on July 7, [[1939]] when Chinese and Japanese forces engaged following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident
	- In the [[United States]], the war began on December 7, [[1941]] after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor
	- In [[Russia]], the war "officially" began on June 22, 1941 after [[Germany]] attacked their mainland
		- The Russian invasion of [[Poland]] on September 17, 1939, [[Finland]], and the Baltic states is airbrushed from the popular narrative
	- Both [[Great Britain]] and [[France]] formally declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939, but did nothing to aid their ally in Poland
		- Nothing much happened until German forces pushed into France in May [[1940]], the time before being called the "[[Phoney War]]"
	- In Germany, the war began on September 1, 1939 when Hitler's forces crossed onto the Polish border on foot, in tanks and vehicles, while the [[Luftwaffe]] secured the skies, bombing and strafing towns and sites indiscriminately 

	- As Germany and the Soviet Union collapsed onto Poland, forgetting preceding years of hatred, Poland fell into a dark age of war, death, and persecution
	- Following the slogan of "First to Fight", the September invasion of Poland cost 200,000 lives and showcased brutal practices which would be abused later in the war including targeting civilian populations indiscriminate aerial bombing, and mass killings
	- Just as the Wehrmacht unleashed a race war against the Poles in the west, the Soviet Union imported a class war in the east
	Germany
	- History is written by the victors
	- As Hitler said, "The victor will never be asked if he told the truth"
	- The German narrative of the early war was the extent of their victories, brilliance of Blitzkrieg, and emphasized the inferiority of their opponents
	Soviet Union
	- On the Soviet side, they would do everything to pretend they never invaded Poland
	- Stalin could not allow an acknowledgement that he facilitated Hitler in starting the conflict and assisting his ally in invading, partitioning, and destroying Poland
		- Their invasion was dressed up as humanitarian intervention and any mention otherwise was suppressed, still continued today
	Britain
	- England shamefully betrayed their ally and did not support Poland in their time of need
	Poland
	- In the end, it was left to Poland to tell the story of two invasions as no other country would focus on this aspect of the war
	- In the postwar years, a Communist Poland was disinterested in publicizing these events except to damn the Nazis
	- By the 1960's a new narrative emerged of the ordinary Polish soldier was betrayed by the ineptitude of his superiors and duplicity if his capitalist allies while also denying any Soviet role
	- Only after the the Communist system collapsed in 1989 would these aspects of Polish history be revealed
The Nazi mythology of an easy Blitzkrieg victory and Soviet lie that the Red Army never invaded at all would be debunked
