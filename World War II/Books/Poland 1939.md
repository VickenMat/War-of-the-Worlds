Preface
- The start of WWII is shrouded in confusion across the globe - each combatant has their own entry point
	- In [[China]] and [[Japan]], the war is said to have begun on July 7, [[1939]] when Chinese and Japanese forces engaged following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident
	- In the [[United States]], the war began on December 7, [[1941]] after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor
	- In [[Russia]], the war "officially" began on June 22, 1941 after [[Germany]] attacked their mainland
		- The Russian invasion of [[Poland]] on September 17, 1939, [[Finland]], and the Baltic states is airbrushed from the popular narrative
	- Both [[Great Britain]] and [[France]] formally declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939, but did nothing to aid their ally in Poland
		- Nothing much happened until German forces pushed into France in May [[1940]], the time before being called the "[[Phoney War]]"
	- In Germany, the war began on September 1, 1939 when Hitler's forces crossed onto the Polish border on foot, in tanks and vehicles, while the [[Luftwaffe]] secured the skies, bombing and strafing towns and sites indiscriminately 

	- As Germany and the Soviet Union collapsed onto Poland, forgetting preceding years of hatred, Poland fell into a dark age of war, death, and persecution
	- Following the slogan of "First to Fight", the September invasion of Poland cost 200,000 lives and showcased brutal practices which would be abused later in the war including targeting civilian populations indiscriminate aerial bombing, and mass killings
	- Just as the Wehrmacht unleashed a race war against the Poles in the west, the Soviet Union imported a class war in the east
	Germany
	- History is written by the victors
	- As Hitler said, "The victor will never be asked if he told the truth"
	- The German narrative of the early war was the extent of their victories, brilliance of Blitzkrieg, and emphasized the inferiority of their opponents
	Soviet Union
	- On the Soviet side, they would do everything to pretend they never invaded Poland
	- Stalin could not allow an acknowledgement that he facilitated Hitler in starting the conflict and assisting his ally in invading, partitioning, and destroying Poland
		- Their invasion was dressed up as humanitarian intervention and any mention otherwise was suppressed, still continued today
	Britain
	- England shamefully betrayed their ally and did not support Poland in their time of need
	Poland
	- In the end, it was left to Poland to tell the story of two invasions as no other country would focus on this aspect of the war
	- In the postwar years, a Communist Poland was disinterested in publicizing these events except to damn the Nazis
	- By the 1960's a new narrative emerged of the ordinary Polish soldier was betrayed by the ineptitude of his superiors and duplicity if his capitalist allies while also denying any Soviet role
	- Only after the the Communist system collapsed in 1989 would these aspects of Polish history be revealed
The Nazi mythology of an easy Blitzkrieg victory and Soviet lie that the Red Army never invaded at all would be debunked

An Unremarkable Man
- Tensions between Germany and Poland had been strained for the last 2 decades *why?*
	- Primarily because Germany's territorial losses to Poland in the [[Treaty of Versailles]]
		- Upper Silesia, Posen, and the Polish Corridor
	- This was seen as profound humiliation in Germany and led to the poisoning of their relationship
	- [[Adolf Hitler]] however had racial prejudice and believed Germany's national destiny lay in expansion to the east
	- He began ramping up propaganda about Polish barbarism and bad faith
- Hitler wanted war but faced 2 problems
	- Poland had allies in Britain and France, both pledging to defend it from foreign aggression *why did they ally?*
	- Vast majority of German people had no stomach for another war
		- **Hitler had to make the war seem defensive**
		- Poland would need to be seen as the aggressor and Germany the innocent victim
		- In this way the German people might be persuaded for war and Poland might be detached from foreign allies
		- "The destruction of Poland has priority... the aim is to eliminate active forces, not reach a definitive line. Even if war breaks out in the West, the destruction of Poland remains a primary objective" -Hitler
		- When it came to public opinion, he assured his commanders propagandist reason for starting the war
		- **"The victor will not be asked afterwards whether he told the truth"** - Hitler
		- German military intelligence, [[Abwehr]] was tasked with undermining Poland
			- In the last weeks of August, it had a spate of incidents intended to seem as they were inspired by anti-German sentiment
		- In 1939, German newspapers carried countless reports the called "Polish Terror" complaining for Polish bandits, growing nervousness and frightful suffering of German refugees
- [[Alfred Naujock]], the architect of the [[Gleiwitz Incident]] man who arguably began the Second World War had a plan at [[Gleiwitz]]
	- Originally it was to go without bloodshed, but his superiors decided the attack needed more clinching evidence
	- [[Heinrich Muller]] informed Naujock that he would be supplied with a bloodied Pole corpse, and they needed it to be of someone with a proven history of anti-German agitation
	- The victim would be [[Franciszek Honiok]], 
	- After receiving the code "Grandmother has died", the plan was initiated
		- His men changed into civilian clothes and journeyed to the transmitter station in Gleiwitz
		- They took over the building and sent all the workers to the basement
		- They decided to attack the transmitter station itself, where there was a "storm microphone" used to interrupt local programs in case of extreme weather but with much reduced possibility to be monitored and interrupted
		- A pistol was fired in the air and they announced, "Attention! Here is Gleiwitz! The radio station is in Polish hands!" which was supposed to be a call to arms from the Polish people in Germany
			- Only these 9 words were uttered clearly and the rest was lost to static
			- Honiok was given an injection to make him unconscious and driven to the station, where he was allegedly shot and killed
				- Naujock would maintain until his death that neither him nor his men shot Honiok
				- **A single death to preface 50 million more**
			- It didn't matter that the ruse failed, German media was already primed to run the story on the Polish "attack" on Gleiwitz
		- By the time the German public would hear this, Hitler's tanks were already marching into Poland

Westerplatte Fights On
- [[Danzig]] had long been an area of tension between the two countries as though it was ethically predominantly German, the Treaty of Versailles had established it as a free state - transport and trade concessions were given to Poland
	- Danzig was now effectively Poland's port
	- Poland was then granted the peninsula of [[Westerplatte]] to serve as a military depot for the secure unloading of munitions and military hardware
	- Westerplatte would inevitably find itself in the firing line in the event if heightened tensions
	- The first military death of the war was a 25 year old rifleman; [[Stefan Jezierski]]
- **Reaction from the German people** 
	- Streets of the capital were strikingly quiet
	- There was "no enthusiasm" for war
	- Entire German people "seemed seized by a paralyzing horror"
- In Hitler's *speech* to his people, he revisited many of the themes that led to his popularity and **drove his rise to power**
	- Iniquity of the Treaty of Versailles
	- Perfidy of the Western Powers
	- Germany as an eternal victim
	- Poland's refusal to "settle the Corridor question"
		- Its slow strangling of the Free City of Danzig and its oppression of Germans
	- Polish "atrocities"
		- Referring to Hochlinden, Pitschen, and Gleiwitz
- Stated that 
	- "Patience has been mistaken for weakness"
	- Air force would "Restrict itself to attacks on military targets"
	- No desire to "Make war against women and children"
	- The word **"war"** was suspiciously absent from the speech
		- Rather described as "merely engagements which have been brought about by Polish attacks"
- **Public reaction to the speech**
	- This could have been the reason this news was received with indifference
	- Little sense of panic
	- No grasp of the momentous nature of the events they were witnessing
	- "The people on the streets were apathetic despite the immensity of the news which had greeted them from their radios"
	- "No one laid down their tools to buy one [special edition newspaper]"
	- *apathy*
- **Mood in Poland**
	- Mixture of defiance and optimism
	- Morale from Polish pilots were "fantastic", not even minding they were flying outdated aircraft
	- "One thing is certain, I felt relaxed or even happy, that the exhausting wait was over and the game had begun"
	- "We are not afraid. We must win and we shall win. We won 20 years ago and we shall win again now. Back when we were weaker and won Poland back, and now that we are strong we will not give away a single piece of our land"
	- The morning newspaper spoke of Poland's "Finger on the trigger" and "Hitler's ludicrous demands"
	- Branch director and his deputy were in "excellent mood"
	- One Polish air force major noted that it "seemed quite naive of the Germans to have believed that during the preceding days of high political tension and with their own obviously aggressive intensions, we would leave our units sitting at their peacetime bases"
- Attacks on Poland
	- The German mission on [[Tczew]], which was to prevent the Poles from destroying their own bridges to prevent their troops to cross was a failure
		- Stukas were supposed to knock out the power plant and cabling to prevent the detonation of mines with diversionary raids elsewhere and a hijacked train to unload German soldiers
	- The town of [[Wielun]] (16,000 residents), was at Hitler's mercy
		- A Luftwaffe report would mention there was "no sign of the enemy"
		- 70% of its buildings were destroyed, including hospitals, churches, and the market square
		- Over 55 US tons were dropped, flattening the city
			- The questions of *why* Wielun was targeted is still up for debate
				- Cynical exercise to boost morale?
				- Raid made in error with incorrect intelligence?
				- Psychological warfare to break the spirit of the Poles?
		- Hitler's claim that his airmen would be restricted to attacking military targets was a *lie*
