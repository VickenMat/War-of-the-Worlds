Preface
- The start of WWII is shrouded in confusion across the globe - each combatant has their own entry point
	- In [[China]] and [[Japan]], the war is said to have begun on July 7, [[1939]] when Chinese and Japanese forces engaged following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident
	- In the [[United States]], the war began on December 7, [[1941]] after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor
	- In [[Russia]], the war "officially" began on June 22, 1941 after [[Germany]] attacked their mainland
		- The Russian invasion of [[Poland]] on September 17, 1939, [[Finland]], and the Baltic states is airbrushed from the popular narrative
	- Both [[Great Britain]] and [[France]] formally declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939, but did nothing to aid their ally in Poland
		- Nothing much happened until German forces pushed into France in May [[1940]], the time before being called the "[[Phoney War]]"
	- In Germany, the war began on September 1, 1939 when Hitler's forces crossed onto the Polish border on foot, in tanks and vehicles, while the [[Luftwaffe]] secured the skies, bombing and strafing towns and sites indiscriminately 

	- As Germany and the Soviet Union collapsed onto Poland, forgetting preceding years of hatred, Poland fell into a dark age of war, death, and persecution
	- Following the slogan of "First to Fight", the September invasion of Poland cost 200,000 lives and showcased brutal practices which would be abused later in the war including targeting civilian populations indiscriminate aerial bombing, and mass killings
	- Just as the Wehrmacht unleashed a race war against the Poles in the west, the Soviet Union imported a class war in the east
	Germany
	- History is written by the victors
	- As Hitler said, "The victor will never be asked if he told the truth"
	- The German narrative of the early war was the extent of their victories, brilliance of Blitzkrieg, and emphasized the inferiority of their opponents
	Soviet Union
	- On the Soviet side, they would do everything to pretend they never invaded Poland
	- Stalin could not allow an acknowledgement that he facilitated Hitler in starting the conflict and assisting his ally in invading, partitioning, and destroying Poland
		- Their invasion was dressed up as humanitarian intervention and any mention otherwise was suppressed, still continued today
	Britain
	- England shamefully betrayed their ally and did not support Poland in their time of need
	Poland
	- In the end, it was left to Poland to tell the story of two invasions as no other country would focus on this aspect of the war
	- In the postwar years, a Communist Poland was disinterested in publicizing these events except to damn the Nazis
	- By the 1960's a new narrative emerged of the ordinary Polish soldier was betrayed by the ineptitude of his superiors and duplicity if his capitalist allies while also denying any Soviet role
	- Only after the the Communist system collapsed in 1989 would these aspects of Polish history be revealed
The Nazi mythology of an easy Blitzkrieg victory and Soviet lie that the Red Army never invaded at all would be debunked

An Unremarkable Man
- Tensions between Germany and Poland had been strained for the last 2 decades *why?*
	- Primarily because Germany's territorial losses to Poland in the [[Treaty of Versailles]]
		- Upper Silesia, Posen, and the Polish Corridor
	- This was seen as profound humiliation in Germany and led to the poisoning of their relationship
	- [[Adolf Hitler]] however had racial prejudice and believed Germany's national destiny lay in expansion to the east
	- He began ramping up propaganda about Polish barbarism and bad faith
- Hitler wanted war but faced 2 problems
	- Poland had allies in Britain and France, both pledging to defend it from foreign aggression *why did they ally?*
	- Vast majority of German people had no stomach for another war
		- **Hitler had to make the war seem defensive**
		- Poland would need to be seen as the aggressor and Germany the innocent victim
		- In this way the German people might be persuaded for war and Poland might be detached from foreign allies
		- "The destruction of Poland has priority... the aim is to eliminate active forces, not reach a definitive line. Even if war breaks out in the West, the destruction of Poland remains a primary objective" -Hitler
		- When it came to public opinion, he assured his commanders propagandist reason for starting the war
		- **"The victor will not be asked afterwards whether he told the truth"** - Hitler
		- German military intelligence, [[Abwehr]] was tasked with undermining Poland
			- In the last weeks of August, it had a spate of incidents intended to seem as they were inspired by anti-German sentiment
		- In 1939, German newspapers carried countless reports the called "Polish Terror" complaining for Polish bandits, growing nervousness and frightful suffering of German refugees
- [[Alfred Naujock]], the architect of the [[Gleiwitz Incident]] man who arguably began the Second World War had a plan at [[Gleiwitz]]
	- Originally it was to go without bloodshed, but his superiors decided the attack needed more clinching evidence
	- [[Heinrich Muller]] informed Naujock that he would be supplied with a bloodied Pole corpse, and they needed it to be of someone with a proven history of anti-German agitation
	- The victim would be [[Franciszek Honiok]], 
	- After receiving the code "Grandmother has died", the plan was initiated
		- His men changed into civilian clothes and journeyed to the transmitter station in Gleiwitz
		- They took over the building and sent all the workers to the basement
		- They decided to attack the transmitter station itself, where there was a "storm microphone" used to interrupt local programs in case of extreme weather but with much reduced possibility to be monitored and interrupted
		- A pistol was fired in the air and they announced, "Attention! Here is Gleiwitz! The radio station is in Polish hands!" which was supposed to be a call to arms from the Polish people in Germany
			- Only these 9 words were uttered clearly and the rest was lost to static
			- Honiok was given an injection to make him unconscious and driven to the station, where he was allegedly shot and killed
				- Naujock would maintain until his death that neither him nor his men shot Honiok
				- **A single death to preface 50 million more**
			- It didn't matter that the ruse failed, German media was already primed to run the story on the Polish "attack" on Gleiwitz
		- By the time the German public would hear this, Hitler's tanks were already marching into Poland

Westerplatte Fights On
- [[Danzig]] had long been an area of tension between the two countries as though it was ethically predominantly German, the Treaty of Versailles had established it as a free state - transport and trade concessions were given to Poland
	- Danzig was now effectively Poland's port
	- Poland was then granted the peninsula of [[Westerplatte]] to serve as a military depot for the secure unloading of munitions and military hardware
	- Westerplatte would inevitably find itself in the firing line in the event if heightened tensions
	- The first military death of the war was a 25 year old rifleman; [[Stefan Jezierski]]
- **Reaction from the German people** 
	- Streets of the capital were strikingly quiet
	- There was "no enthusiasm" for war
	- Entire German people "seemed seized by a paralyzing horror"
- In Hitler's *speech* to his people, he revisited many of the themes that led to his popularity and **drove his rise to power**
	- Iniquity of the Treaty of Versailles
	- Perfidy of the Western Powers
	- Germany as an eternal victim
	- Poland's refusal to "settle the Corridor question"
		- Its slow strangling of the Free City of Danzig and its oppression of Germans
	- Polish "atrocities"
		- Referring to Hochlinden, Pitschen, and Gleiwitz
- Stated that 
	- "Patience has been mistaken for weakness"
	- Air force would "Restrict itself to attacks on military targets"
	- No desire to "Make war against women and children"
	- The word **"war"** was suspiciously absent from the speech
		- Rather described as "merely engagements which have been brought about by Polish attacks"
- **Public reaction to the speech**
	- This could have been the reason this news was received with indifference
	- Little sense of panic
	- No grasp of the momentous nature of the events they were witnessing
	- "The people on the streets were apathetic despite the immensity of the news which had greeted them from their radios"
	- "No one laid down their tools to buy one [special edition newspaper]"
	- *apathy*
- **Mood in Poland**
	- Mixture of defiance and optimism
	- Morale from Polish pilots were "fantastic", not even minding they were flying outdated aircraft
	- "One thing is certain, I felt relaxed or even happy, that the exhausting wait was over and the game had begun"
	- "We are not afraid. We must win and we shall win. We won 20 years ago and we shall win again now. Back when we were weaker and won Poland back, and now that we are strong we will not give away a single piece of our land"
	- The morning newspaper spoke of Poland's "Finger on the trigger" and "Hitler's ludicrous demands"
	- Branch director and his deputy were in "excellent mood"
	- One Polish air force major noted that it "seemed quite naive of the Germans to have believed that during the preceding days of high political tension and with their own obviously aggressive intensions, we would leave our units sitting at their peacetime bases"
- Attacks on Poland
	- The German mission on [[Tczew]], which was to prevent the Poles from destroying their own bridges to prevent their troops to cross was a failure
		- Stukas were supposed to knock out the power plant and cabling to prevent the detonation of mines with diversionary raids elsewhere and a hijacked train to unload German soldiers
	- The town of [[Wielun]] (16,000 residents), was at Hitler's mercy
		- A Luftwaffe report would mention there was "no sign of the enemy"
		- 70% of its buildings were destroyed, including hospitals, churches, and the market square
		- Over 55 US tons were dropped, flattening the city
			- The questions of *why* Wielun was targeted is still up for debate
				- Cynical exercise to boost morale?
				- Raid made in error with incorrect intelligence?
				- Psychological warfare to break the spirit of the Poles?
		- Hitler's claim that his airmen would be restricted to attacking military targets was a *lie*
	- On the first day of the war, the Luftwaffe launched more than 2,000 sorties carrying raids on over 100 Polish cities - none of them were shot down
		- German propaganda would claim the war had already been won
		- One officer noted, "I light a cigarette-when it goes out, the war will be on"
		- German soldiers often carried out ceremonial destruction of the border post as they passed it for the propaganda unit
	- The first Wound Badge of the war was given to [[Ottomar Domizlaff]] after receiving a friendly fire wound to his butt
	- "Without resistance, we marched into Poland"
		- Goal was to cut off Polish forces in the north and reunite Prussia with the Reich - which had been enemy territory only a generation before
- At [[Krojanty]], one of the last cavalry charges of its kind was launched by the 18th Cavalry Unit against German infantry
	- At first the Germans were caught off guard, then their tanks came out of hiding - this would be a baptism by fire
- In [[Mokra]], the Germans were humbled and would realize the Poles would not roll over and die
	- They were now seen as neither incompetent or lacking in determination
	- Although eventually taking the town, the Germans incurred 490 casualties and a resilient defense
	- Helmuth von Moltke's maxim was "No battle plan survives first contact with the enemy"
- The ***sentiment*** after the first night was best said in the quote
	- "Tonight everywhere there are burning villages, houses, and barns. Here and there wild shooting, supposedly irregulars. Everywhere there is nervousness"
	- In the first 3 days alone there were 72 mass executions, claiming 800 victims - a brutal benchmark for the rest of the campaign
	- Head of the British military mission to Poland [[Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart]] stated, **I saw the very face of war change...bereft of romance, its glory shorn, no longer the soldiers setting forth into battle, but the women and children buried under it**
- The image that the world would come to know of the campaign- ***of an inept, irresolute enemy unable to resist the German advance and foolhardy enough to charge advancing tanks with cavalry***-would be a fiction of [[Joseph Goebbel]] propaganda
	- The Poles had shown they were determined to defend themselves. It just remained to be seen how Paris and London would respond to the German attacks

The Tyranny of Geography
- [[Wilson's Fourteen Points]] of January [[1918]] stated that Poland should be restored as an independent state and must have "free and secure access to the sea" and all those territories "inhabited by indisputably Polish populations"
	- The collapse of the [[Russia]]n Empire in [[1917]] and Central Powers in 1918 enabled Poland to reemerge after an absence of 123 years
- The [[Miracle on the Vistula]] not only saved Central and Western Europe from communism but also dented the Kremlin's ambitions
	- It was a setback Stalin would neither forget nor forgive
- Neither Germany nor Russia was reconciled to the territorial losses they had each incurred due to the first World War and ***the reconstituted Poland would represent a large portion of the irredenta***
	- [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] would later describe Poland as "the monstrous bastard of the Peace of Versailles" - a view shared by Hitler
		- *Would be considered as "one of the firmest guiding principles of German policy" as the existence of Poland was "intolerable and incompatible with Germany's vital interests*"
			- **The logical basis for German-Russian collaboration was that Poland should be made to disappear
	- [[Doctrine of Two Enemies]] stated that Poland would maintain correct and cordial relations with both Germany and the Soviet Union, but ally with neither
		- A Polish-Soviet nonaggression pact was signed in July 1932 in an attempt to conduct a preventative strike against Germany
		- A Polish-German nonaggression pact was signed with Hitler in January 1934 - Poland seemed to be internationally secure
	- Polish military spending in the 5 years before [[1939]] was 3% of what Hitler spent in the same time period
		- The amount Germany would spend to equipped a single armored division exceeded the annual budget for the Polish Army
			- *Poland's postwar military leadership had not experienced the horrors of trench warfare and so failed to see that mechanization was the future*
			- *Eastern Poland still had wide spaces, extensive marshes, and lack of infrastructure which still lended to cavalry*
	- The emerging [[Blitzkrieg]] foresaw tanks punching holes in enemy lines which following infantry could exploit
		- The Luftwaffe boasted 2,500 aircraft compared to the measly 400 from the Poles
		- Germans had an advanced Panzer III and IV
	- Polands's strategic planning in 1939 was predicated upon material military assistance from foreign allies - [[Great Britain]] and [[France]]
		- Zachod meant holding out until an Allied offensive in the west could relieve German pressure - which would never come because they all wanted different things
	- The [[Munich Conference]] sealed the cession of the [[Sudetenland]] to Germany, which Hitler claimed to be his "last territorial demand in Europe"
- Polands relationship with Britain and France was curious
	- Polish mentality
		- They had an ally in France and Britain
	- British/French mentality
		- Poland was more of a tool than an ally
		- Military planners full well knew there was very little they could do to practically help Poland in their hour of need
		- They were using Poland to ***contain Hitler*** - to conjure up the specter of war and hope it would be enough of a deterrent
			- Problem was, Hitler was not going to be deterred
			- He did not believe Poland deserved to exist
		- Anglo-French delegation had been sent to Moscow in the hopes that their potential collaboration would scare Hitler into compliance
			- The fundamental problem was, **the Soviets wanted to change the equilibrium, Britain and France wanted to preserve it**
	- Soviet Union mentality
		- Stalin wanted to return to the original ideology of the Soviet Union, *the outside world was seen as uniformly hostile, with no qualitative differences between Nazis and capitalism*
			- They were two sides of the same malevolent coin, the only difference **Nazism was further down the road to an inevitable demise**
			- Stalin knew that was could be a powerful motor in "changing the equilibrium"
				- He was certainly not adverse to letting his ideological enemies fight each other
					- "We see nothing wrong with their having a good hard fight and weakening each other"
					- *Hitler, without understanding or desiring it, is shaking and undermining the capitalist system*
					- "Lenin was not mistaken when he assured us that the Second World War will help is to gain power throughout all Europe, *just as the First World War helped us gain power in Russia"
	- German mentality
		- Germany was willing to pay any price to prevent an alignment between the USSR and Western Powers and Berlin would give up the Baltic states, Bessarabia, and eastern Poland if it meat avoiding it
	- See [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]
	- On August 29, Poland ordered then subsequently cancelled a general mobilization
		- This was due to London and Paris believing Berlin would interpret this as provocative
			- However, Allied attempts at mediation had done nothing except *hamstring Polish defenses*

A Frightful Futility
- "We shall stand at the bar of history knowing that the responsibility for this terrible catastrophe lies on the shoulders of one man, the German Chancellor, who has not hesitated to* plunge the world into misery in order to serve his own senseless ambitions*"
	- "No peace in Europe" as long as the Nazi regime existed
- There was some optimism for Britain and France
- Britain
	- Navy
		- Primarily a naval power in 1939 - largest navy in the world
		- They had the largest merchant fleet in the world - one in three of all
	- Army
		- Standard issue [[Lee-Enfield]] rifle and [[Bren]] light machine gun
		- [[Matilda Mark II]] tank which had the thickest armor at the time but only a handful had been delivered at the time
		- They relief on the [[Matilda Mark I]]
	- Air Force
		- 1,660 aircraft, led by the [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Spitfire]]
	- Its empire had been built on international trade
	- Its global reach traditionally required a navy to police sea lanes and protect its far-flung interests
- France
	- Army
		- Second largest army in the world, behind the Soviets
		- 900,000 men with 5 million trained reservists in autumn of 1939
		- [[Char B1]] heavy tank boasted as the best tank available
	- Air Force
		- 1,000 operational aircraft, led by the [[Morane-Saulnier]]
	- Navy
		- Much smaller than Britain, with 70 destroyers, 19 cruisers, and 7 battleships crewed by 160,000 men
- *Britain and France complemented each other well, ones shortcoming were the other's strength* and they arguably held the upper hand
	- The British army needed the French as comrades in arms to launch any effective action against Germany
- **Huge French losses-human and material- in the first World War, coupled with political turmoil thereafter, had nurtured a faith in the policy of appeasing Germany
	- Maginot mentality
		- *How can anyone believe that we continue to think of offensives when we have spent billions of francs to establish a fortified barrier*
	- The British believed in two main points
		- No negotiation with Germany unless it was prepared to withdraw its troops from Poland
		- Delay beyond midnight was "undesirable" and this constituted an ultimatum
			- However there was no mention of the aid or defense of Poland
		- [[Arthur Greenwood]] stated, "How long are we prepared to vacillate at a time when Britain and all that Britain stand stands for, and human civilization, are in peril"
- French Prime Minister [[Edouard Daladier]] and [[Neville Chamberlain]] had been the architects of appeasement and a cosignatory of the [[Munich Agreement]]
- The defense of Poland from the British and French point of view
	- Fight
		- *If France should allow this aggression to be carried out, it would very soon find itself "despised, isolated, and discredited, without allies or support*
		- "Standing by Poland was a matter of not only a vital interest, but of the highest principle"
	- Appease
		- [[Marcel Deat]] stated that Hitler would be sated with the cession of [[Danzig]] and that Polish intransigence was dragging all of Europe into war
			- This had become the mentality for any French in support of non intervention
	- Delay
		- [[Maurice Gamelin]] mentioned that despite having committed his army, earlier in the summer, to assist Poland in the event of an attack, he had no intention of, nor consequently, had the French military  any plan for launching an immediate assault on Germany
		- He was convinced that Germany was poised ready to attack the West upon any declaration of war
	- Detach
